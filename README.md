# LastWish Plugin
LastWish is a secure plugin designed for unexpected situations (such as accidents) where the original owner is unable to perform actions on a Safe (a digital wallet with assets), either due to accidental death or incapacity. This plugin allows for the transfer of Safe ownership to a designated address, preventing the assets within the Safe from being permanently locked.

## Problem to solve
In case of the Safe owner's death, LastWish allows assets to be transferred to a chosen inheritor, avoiding locked-up assets. Despite cryptocurrency's focus on profit, accidents can happen, leading to locked assets. This results in permanent loss and affects loved ones. LastWish solves this by ensuring assets go to loved ones, even during unexpected events, without sharing existing permissions. This addresses the concern of inheritor misuseâ€”a common issue.


## Features
- User-friendly and easy to comprehend
- Directly compatible with existing Safes, requiring no additional setup
- Supports both the original Safe Module architecture([LastWishModule.sol](./src/LastWishModule.sol)) and the new Safe Plugin architecture([LastWishPlugin.sol](./src/LastWishPlugin.sol))

## How to Use
1. The Safe owner can designate an inheritor and set a lockout period within the LastWish configuration.

2. In the unfortunate event that the Gnosis owner is unable to perform Safe operations due to unforeseen circumstances, the designated inheritor can initiate a transfer request for the Safe, which then enters a locked state for a specified duration.

3. Once the lockout period has elapsed, the inheritor can proceed to claim ownership of the Safe and gain the authority to operate it.

4. In cases where the inheritor's intentions are malicious, the Safe owner retains the ability to reject the transfer request during the lockout period.
Simultaneously, the inheritor's access rights will be revoked. It is advisable to employ [Forta](https://forta.org/) to monitor whether any inheritance requests have been initiated by the inheritor.
